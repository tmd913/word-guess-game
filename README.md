# Who's That Pokemon?

## Overview

Try to guess the name of the Pokemon. There are four difficulties, each with different battle and victory songs, that change the amount of guesses you get per game.

## Instructions

Click a ball corresponding to the difficulty level to get to the main game. Then click the new game button to populate the screen with the outline of the Pokemon you need to guess. There are also buttons to reselect a ball and pause the song. 

Once your game has started, use your keyboard to guess a letter. The game will end either when you guess the Pokemon correctly or when you are out of guesses.

Have fun!
